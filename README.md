# Learn-ASL (YOLO training)

## Setting Up
The following is the Kaggle link for the dataset we are using the train: https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/american-sign-language-letters </br>
Data is pre-labeled so we get to skip that step, unless this dataset doesn't work well. However, we simply have to just train the YOLOv11 model on it, I already have the configurations set up. </br>
You actually don't have to do anything except just run train.py to start training, and then we have to figure out the best way to configure test.py to actually test out the model's performance.

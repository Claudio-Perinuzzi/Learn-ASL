# Learn-ASL (YOLO training)

## Setting Up
The following is the Kaggle link for the dataset we are using the train: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshvardhan21/sign-language-detection-using-images </br>
If this sentence is still here, means we have to split the data into train and eval since the config.yaml requires those splits. For now, you should only be changing the path to your own for your own personal use. I'll just be saving my own path locally for when I git pull. </br>
### Importing the kaggle dataset
You can either use kagglehub regularly or Kaggle CLI to install your dataset on your local machine. Or even better, you can use the API (I'm not prioritizing that right now personally). Once you either use Kagglehub or Kaggle CLI, you should be given a path to the dataset, and add the path with the /data at the end to the config.yaml file. Environment should be properly set now, more instructions and progress to come later.
